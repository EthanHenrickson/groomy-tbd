	<h2>Our Passion for Pups</h2>

	<p>
		At Groomy, we're more than just a software company – we're a team of dedicated dog lovers
		on a mission to make the world a better place for our furry friends.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Story</h2>

	<p>
		Groomy was born from a simple observation: the joy that a well-groomed dog brings to both
		its owner and itself. Our founder, a long-time dog groomer, realized that by streamlining the
		business side of grooming, professionals could spend more time doing what they love – caring for
		dogs.
	</p>

	<h2>Who We Are</h2>

	We're a diverse group of tech enthusiasts, pet care professionals, and business experts. But above
	all, we're dog people. Our team includes:
	<ul>
		<li>Experienced groomers who understand the daily challenges of the profession</li>
		<li>Software developers with a knack for creating user-friendly solutions</li>
		<li>Customer support specialists who go the extra mile (or should we say, the extra walk?)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Why We Do It</h2>

	<p>
		Every line of code we write, every feature we develop, and every customer we support is driven
		by our love for dogs. We believe that by making the lives of groomers easier, we're contributing
		to happier, healthier pups everywhere.
	</p>
