    Groomy is a one-person operation founded by Marcia, a lifelong dog lover with a passion for providing exceptional grooming care. After years of working in traditional grooming salons, I decided to strike out on my own and create a mobile service that brings the same high-quality treatments directly to your doorstep.
As the sole groomer at Groomy, I take great pride in getting to know each of my canine clients and their unique needs. Whether it's a playful puppy or a seasoned senior, I approach every dog with the utmost care and gentleness, ensuring they have a positive and stress-free experience. My mission is to make your dog look and feel their absolute best, while providing you with the convenience and peace of mind that comes from having a trusted groomer come to you.
